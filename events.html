	<h2>EVENTS AND ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
	
	<p>Every year, hundreds of activities take place in Jozi, ranging from major sporting events and music festivals to small wine tastings and urban markets. Many of these festivals and competitions are suitable for the whole family, although others are more limited. The climate is cooler, and the area is unique and full of character, making it a perfect location for a wide variety of activities.</p>

         <p>We've compiled the best nightlife guide to Joburg, complete with pubs, clubs, restaurants, and bistros, so you can schedule your night out. From hipster bars and dance clubs to historic pubs and bar districts, Joburg has it all. The only snag is that nightlife areas are dispersed across the capital, but this only adds to the city's liveliest areas, such as Sandton, Rosebank, Maboneng, and Melville.</p>
