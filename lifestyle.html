and moulded into a visually stimulating space, as part of Propertuity’s vision to breath new life into the region, and it now boast a renewed atmosphere that 
inspires others to express their creativity. The region is home to a host of art galleries, stores where uniquely designed items can be purchased, museums where artistic 
expression is apparent and a number of graffiti walls.It goes without saying that this creative hub should be high on your travel list.</p>
