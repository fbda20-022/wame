         <h1>History of the City</h1>
         <p>The city was established in 1886 following the discovery of gold on what had been a farm. Due to the extremely large gold deposit found along the 
Witwatersrand, within ten years, the population had grown to 100,000 inhabitants.By 1924 as the scale of gold deposits became apparent, Johannesburg transformed 
from a dusty farm into a beautiful city with skyscrapers.</p>
